# A Little Devil in America - Hanif Abduraqib

11/14 - Just started this book. I'm immediately reminded of Abduraqib's style of writing. At first it
appears he is merely sharing a memory, perhaps presenting some research he's done that's vaguely
related then almost imperceptibly he switches into what can only be referred to as verse. Abduraqib
is a poet first, I'm looking forward to reading the rest of this.
