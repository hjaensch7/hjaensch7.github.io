# A Little Devil in America - Hanif Abduraqib

11/14 - Just started this book. I'm immediately reminded of Abduraqib's style of writing. At first it
appears he is merely sharing a memory, perhaps presenting some research he's done that's vaguely
related then almost imperceptibly he switches into what can only be referred to as verse. Abduraqib
is a poet first, I'm looking forward to reading the rest of this.

11/28 - This book is devastating. It can at times be difficult to read, very powerful emotions are
summoned. This is the second book I have read by Abduraqib I think I will now read anything with his
name on it.
