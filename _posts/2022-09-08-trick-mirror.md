# Trick Mirror - Jia Tolentino

TODO: post

brain dump
- I enjoyed this book
- I regret that I didn't savor this for longer
- The essay on optimization was really perceptive, I find myself eating the 12$
salad from JustSalad. It's strange, now that eating my 12$ salad has been
framed as as symptom of late state capitalism and optimizing everything I still
find myself showing up to JustSalad like clockwork. I know I'm participating in
the absurd system but can't bring myself to stop.

- The final essay does this wonderful balance where Tolentino identifies that
she may ultimately end up giving life or virility to patriarchy by engaging with
it. This idea that we may end up acknowledging and validating the very thing we
are denouncing. Tolentino does a better job of articulating this. After
acknowledging it's possible to make this mistake she continues to tow a fine
line and even concedes when she becomes close to crossing it. This is an
impressive demonstration of self awareness within a piece.
