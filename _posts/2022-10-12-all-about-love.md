# All About Love - Bell Hooks

I read this book one chapter at a time, in an attempt to give each chatper room to breath. 
This book feels like a guide a treatise on love and a review of literatue.
About halfway through I was convinced I would read it again, and I think I will.
I heard someone say this book should be required reading(whatever that means), and I think I agree.
