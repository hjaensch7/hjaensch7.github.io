# Wild Sheep Chase - Haruki Murakami

- I quite enjoyed this book, it was easy to read and difficult to put down
- Having just finished it I'm a bit perplexed, but I think that's the point
- The few questions I feel were left unanswered appear deliberate.
- The life of the main character was notable depressing, again this is no accident.
- Murakami is able to leverage tremndous control over language. He is able to describe images and feelings which such deft that I was often confused as to how he even arrived at such a metaphor. 
- An example of the above is roughly using a stain spreading through fabric to describe two ideas blending together. 
- This is the first Murakami novel I have read. I'm now excited to read 1Q84 as a friend reccommended it to me.
