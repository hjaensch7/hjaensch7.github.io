# Kitchen Confidential - Anthony Bourdain

Really enjoyed this book. 
Incredibly endearing.
He is able to articulate some of wonder. To capture wonder in words is special
The full circle of his hands throughout the book is great.
His description of his hands recounting where each scar and scab came from was great writing.
Having watched him on programs I can sometimes hear him saying the words as I'm reading them
His love of cooking translates throughout.
Surprisingly I was not hungry reading this, nor do I come away from it wanting to be a line cook.
