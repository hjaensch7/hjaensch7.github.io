# Girl, Woman, Other - Bernardine Evaristo

A collection of short stories about people in london. 

Time serves an imporant role in this book as the stories span multiple generations.

Not explicitly stating relationships between characters helps make it feel like a discovery whenever you realize a connection.

Loved this book. Jumping around between loosly connected stories tying them together slowly.
