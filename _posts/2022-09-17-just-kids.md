# Just Kids - Patti Smith

I just finished this book and feel compelled to get some thoughts down while they are fresh.

I don't expect the organization of these thoughts to be cohesive or sensable.

This is probably just going to wind up as a brain dump of sorts.

Patti Smith has granted me a new appreciation for the Artist, and the pursuit of creation
Her and Roberts dedication to living and creating feels so foreign to me.
Their lifelong commitment to art is awe inspiring.

The book chronicles their life together, shifting in and out of artist and muse back and forth.
A balance, give and take. 

more ideas:
* robert's struggle with his sexuality, loving eachother beyond monogamy
* mysticism around music art and poetry, involking names like dylan, mitchell and ginsberg all without needing them to compell the reader. 
* the story and community around the chelsea hotel inherits excitement and interest from the history of the place
* Many characters seemed to idolize someone, patti: dylan, robert: warhol, might be worth looking for other instances of this in the book I'm sure there are some.
