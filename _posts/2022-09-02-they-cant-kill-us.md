# They Can't Kill Us Until They Kill Us - Hanif Abduraqib

This book is important. It has meaningfully impacted the way I view the world.
I'm personally a big fan of live music. Abduraqib's descriptions of musical performances are perfectly evocative.

Abduraqib is able to take a seemingly isolated performance of a pop artist and seat it comfortably in a cultural/societal context.
