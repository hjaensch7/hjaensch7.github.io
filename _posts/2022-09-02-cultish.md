# Cultish - Amanda Montell

I didn't enjoy this book. 
I did find it interesting. I also learned new things.

The beginning read a bit like a senior thesis. It tries a bit too hard to be cheeky.

While Montell recognizes the existing cultural cachet of Cults she also relies on it heavily throughout the book.
